      <p class="introduction">All Vollebak clothes are delivered with our Mission Sack. Inspired by the amorphous and
        versatile helmet stowage bags on the Apollo 11 mission - which were initially used to store astronauts' visors,
        then later to bring film canisters back to the Command Module - the Mission Sack is designed to be highly
        adaptive for an incredibly low mass.</p>

      <p class="introduction">Built to withstand one mission anywhere in the world, it's engineered around this critical
        'use to weight' ratio. </p>

      <p>As an ultra lightweight dry bag it will keep your phone and passport protected inside your pack. As a sealable
        unit it can be inflated and placed between your jacket and base layer to compress a cushion of air to your chest
        for extra warmth. With its silk-like outer surface it can be stuffed with clothes to make a pillow. And if
        you're not using it, it can be rolled down to the size of a sock and clipped to the outside of your pack. </p>
