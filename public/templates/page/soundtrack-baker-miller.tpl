          This soundtrack has been created for you to listen to whilst wearing the Baker Miller Pink Hoodie. Used together they are designed to help you achieve a natural state of relaxation before and after sport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constructed almost entirely from elements of pink noise, the soundtrack induces a meditative state in your brain by regulating and slowing down your brainwaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Containing every frequency the human ear is capable of hearing, you find pink noise in crashing waves, wind blowing through the trees, and rain hitting the ground. Even your brain produces it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same frequency, known as 1/f, is found in the fluctuations of systems throughout the universe. From your heartbeat and currents in your nervous system, to currents on the ocean floor, the wobble of the earthâ€™s axis, sunspots, time measured by an atomic
          clock, and light emissions from quasars.
