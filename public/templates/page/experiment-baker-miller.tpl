          Between 1979 and 1987, a series of psychological experiments demonstrated how just 15 minutes exposure to a colour named Baker Miller Pink could suppress violent and aggressive behaviour in prisoners and delinquents – calming their minds and tranquilizing
          their muscles. Until now the colour remains untested in the high-pressure waiting periods in adventure sports and expeditions, where the ability to relax can be key to success or survival.

          This experiment aims to help you get into the optimum state of relaxation before or after sport, using colour and sound to slow down your heart rate, your breathing, and your brainwaves. Combining the exact colour of the original tests with a soundtrack
          composed from elements of pink noise, the experiment activates the part of your central nervous system that promotes rest and recuperation, helping you conserve energy and speed up your recovery time.

          For the duration of the experiment the screen will be filled with a single colour – Baker Miller Pink. Don’t expect it to change. It won’t. The only thing that will change is you. The closer you are to the screen, the easier it is for your entire field
          of vision to be saturated with the colour, and the more relaxed you will become.
        </p>
        <p>
          The experiment works best with headphones in a dark space.
