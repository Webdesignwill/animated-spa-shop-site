          This soundtrack is designed to help your brain acclimatise to ‘condition black’ in the same way you would prepare your body for altitude. It aims to increase your tolerance of the Gamma brainwaves your body creates during life and death situations by
          taking your brain from its natural alert and awake state, to one that you would typically associate with panic, fear, and terror.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the speed of your brainwaves increases you are likely to feel hyper alert, lucid or phenomenally powerful. Or you may feel like you want to throw up. Just like altitude its effects on each athlete are hard to predict.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not listen to the soundtrack if you suffer from any mental health conditions, migraines, epilepsy, heart problems, or respiratory issues.
