      <p class="introduction">Surrounded by the forests and mountains on the west coast of Portugal, Petratex feels more
        like a military testing facility or three Michelin star kitchen than a clothing factory. Their modernist steel
        and black glass building houses more than enough R&D to convince you that they will achieve CEO Sergio Neto's

      <p>When the ceramic particles in Ceraspace broke hundreds of their needles during the development of Condition
        Black, other factories would have stopped. Instead our jacket now comes with 19 individual articulated panels.
        Every one is a different shape. They're each laser cut by a robotic arm. Then they're cross-stitched by hand
        onto every jacket in a bespoke pattern.</p>
