        <p class="lead-paragraph">The military elite have a term for your physical and mental state during life and death situations – moments in which your subconscious must choose between fight or flight. They call it ‘condition black.’ The colour code for ‘you’re about to die.’</p>

        <p>The Condition Black jacket is not only built to survive these extreme experiences, but to help keep you alive
          in the aftermath. Constructed using the most resilient, military grade materials in the world today, it
          combines
          the highest levels of elasticity, breathability and insulation with the ability to survive falls of up to
          120kmph across any surface. It even comes with its own training program to enhance your sensory perception
          during life and death moments.</p>

        <p>From magnetic survival pockets and glow in the dark instructions, to a ceramic outer skin so tough it can
          scar
          rock, every unique detail is designed to keep you as comfortable, warm and safe as possible when you’re
          pushing
          the limits of your performance hard enough to know something might just fuck up.</p>

        <p>When Neil Armstrong stepped down from the Lunar Module and onto the Moon’s ‘Sea of Tranquillity,’ he was
          walking into the most extreme conditions anyone had ever faced – an environment where his chances of survival
          could drop to zero with a single mistake.</p>

        <p>Of course NASA did everything they could to decrease the risk. He was dressed in an 81kg, fireproof suit that
          was 25 layers thick. Custom-fitted with convoluted joints, metal coating and silicon fingertips, it was
          capable
          of surviving micrometeoroid hits, and temperatures ranging from -238F to +248F. And Armstrong himself had been
          selected as one of the world’s most brilliant pilots. In his career he had landed planes missing critical
          parts,
          like wings, and survived tailspins in space after bouncing his rocket off the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>Yet alongside this rarefied technology and training was a rectangle of cloth sewn onto his left glove with a
          series of instructions for his moon walk that read like a shopping list: How many rocks to collect. Where to
          walk. What to photograph. When to set up his experiments.</p>

        <p>1960s spacecraft were filled with so many of these notes typed up on pamphlets and cards that astronaut
          Michael
          Collins christened them “the fourth crew member”. The Lunar Module Armstrong climbed out of had 113 pages of
          checklists all written in key words, abbreviations and acronyms.</p>

        <p>The writing on his glove was simply an extension of this. In 490 characters it contained every instruction
          he’d
          need for his two and a half hours on the Moon.</p>

        <p>The reason was entirely pragmatic. The key to his survival was not just in
          the materials he wore. It was in how he responded psychologically to the unknown. Despite being Commander of
          the mission,
          NASA chose not to rely on something as basic as his memory working. Knowing that he would be in a dangerous
          and
          stressful environment he had never encountered before, they decided it would be better if he didn’t have to
          think. He simply had to look at his clothes and do what they said.</p>

        <h2>The Physiology Of Survival</h2>

        <p>It’s rarely the cold itself that kills you. It’s the amount of heat your body loses. To stay alive your core
          temperature has to remain within narrowly defined limits. Anything below 95F and you risk
          hypothermia. At 90F
          you’ll start experiencing amnesia. At 82F you’ll lose consciousness. Below 70F you’ll almost certainly
          die.</p>

        <p>As you sink down the scale towards inevitable death, even counting to 10 or doing up a zip may seem
          insurmountable. The colder you get, the less efficiently your brain functions. And even if you can get it to work, using
          it will increase your heat loss. Trying to calculate the probability of your own survival for instance, could
          cut down your life expectancy to ‘some time tomorrow.’</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row wow fadeInUp">
      <div class="col-xs-offset-1 col-xs-10 col-md-offset-0 col-md-6 left-padded">
        <p>The Condition Black jacket is designed to help you focus on one of the most critical elements of mountain
          survival: keeping your vital organs warm. The warmer you keep them, the higher your body temperature will
          stay.
          While your body will happily sacrifice a couple of fingers or toes, it will only last minutes if your heart,
          lungs or brain stop working.</p>

        <p>Pushing on through exhaustion, or hostile conditions, may feel like it’s going to keep them warm, but it
          ignores one basic equation – if you lose more heat than you make, your body temperature will fall. You can
          still
          become hypothermic in the mountains while moving fast. Even if you have enough energy to carry on you’ll lose
          more than half the heat you produce, as moving your arms and legs blows warm air out and cold air in, and the
          increased blood supply to your muscles raises your surface temperature and increases your heat loss.</p>

        <h2>Protecting Your Core</h2>

        <p>The simplest way to insulate your vital organs is by getting into a foetal position. Crossing your forearms
          over your chest and bringing your knees up, not only reduces the total surface area of your body that’s
          exposed
          to cold, but also protects your armpits, groin and chest which produce and lose the most heat.</p>

        <p>To enable you to get into the ideal foetal position the jacket has been engineered around two Survival
          Pockets.
          There’s one on either side of your upper chest to slide your hands into. Both pockets fasten magnetically,
          which
          means they’ll only open when you want them to. They’re double-lined for warmth. And they’re also colour coded
          to
          minimise thinking. The white writing on the left forearm lines up with the white bar tab on the right
          pocket.</p>

        <p>Applying heat to your arteries also keeps your core warm. So once you’re in position, Condition Black is
          designed to turn your body into its own heat pack without you doing anything. The jacket is precisely
          constructed to use the warmth of your own body to apply residual heat to your three most important arteries,
          by
          doubling and trebling up materials and body parts at these key points.</p>

        <p>By extending the Survival Pockets from your front to your back, your fingers can wrap themselves over the
          muscles between your neck and shoulder, trapping heat in the brachial artery in your armpits and the arterial
          arch in the palms of your hands. The pockets are also positioned so that your thumbs will apply pressure, heat
          and three layers of material to your carotid artery either side of your neck.</p>

        <p>And just as Armstrong’s glove reminded him what to do, you’ll find instructions printed in your sight line on
          the jacket for when your brain and body start shutting down and you’re simply too wasted to think.</p>

        <h2>Ceraspace: Made For The Mountains</h2>

        <p class="intro">Condition Black is constructed from multiple layers of two of the world’s most innovative
          materials, both made by Swiss manufacturer Schoeller – the SpaceX of the textile industry.</p>

        <p>The base layer is an incredibly high-performance soft shell, chosen for its high levels of elasticity,
          breathability and insulation, as well as being windproof and water repellent. Knowing the catalyst for any
          survival situation is actually exposing yourself to risk by pushing your limits in the mountains, this
          material
          is designed to let you do your thing.</p>

        <p>The jacket’s outer layer is made from Ceraspace, which is engineered to survive ‘condition black’ itself. As
          this could be a fall, trauma, or natural disaster, the Ceraspace has been applied as a series of articulated
          panels at key impact points. This maximises your protection, as well as helping the jacket remain as flexible
          as
          possible during extreme movements.</p>

        <p class="intro">Made from a three-dimensional coating of ceramic particles anchored in a polymer matrix,
          Ceraspace is highly resistant to abrasion. Armstrong’s suit could survive micro-meteoroid showers. This jacket
          can survive falls of 120kmph down rock, even if you can’t.</p>

        <p>In the aftermath of ‘condition black’ the Ceraspace performs an entirely different role. Whether you’ve
          snow-kite-boarded into a crevasse, or you’re cocooned in a snow hole, the Ceraspace combines with the base
          layer
          to keep you as warm, dry and insulated as possible. And it does it by behaving like skin.</p>

        <p>The speed at which you lose heat in the cold depends on the difference between the temperature of your outer
          layer and the temperature of the air around you. The bigger the difference, the more heat you lose. That’s why
          your skin turns cold in the cold. It’s your body limiting blood flow to the surface in order to reduce the
          temperature difference.</p>

        <p>In extreme cold Ceraspace mimics this effect by staying as close to the outside air temperature as possible.
          Designed in a lab to withstand very high temperatures, it has an incredibly low ‘heat up rate,’ which means
          however warm your body is beneath it, the Ceraspace will remain cold and your body will lose less heat.</p>

        <h2>In The Event Of Disaster</h2>

        <p>A month before the Moon mission, Nixon’s chief speechwriter, Bill Safire, received a phone call from NASA.
          ‘What,’ they asked him, ‘was the President going to say if the astronauts were left stranded on the moon?’
          Safire’s response came in a memo to the Chief of Staff just 48 hours before Armstrong touched down. Its title
          read: ‘In Event of Moon Disaster.’</p>

        <p>It proposed that after a Presidential address, NASA should end communication with the men, leaving them to
          either run out of oxygen, or commit suicide, before a clergyman should adopt the same procedure as a burial at
          sea, commending their souls to “the deepest of the deep.”</p>

        <p>While your chances of surviving in the mountains are higher than they would be on the Moon, this level of
          pragmatism and preparation is worth copying. So Condition Black is designed to help you limit heat loss in
          case
          you find yourself preparing for a night in the mountains.</p>

        <p>If you’re soaked through you’ll lose heat 25 times faster than if you’re dry. So the jacket’s base layer is
          hydrophobic which makes it water resistant even to downpours. Every seam is taped for waterproofness. And the
          central zip fastens inwards with a neoprene surround so that water can’t get in. Critically, the material is
          also fast drying, so if you do end up falling in ice or water it will dry as quickly as possible.</p>

        <p>Knowing you could be moving through steep, unstable terrain in the dark to find a place to recover, we’ve
          added
          extra Ceraspace to your forearms, which you’ll use to shield your face from branches, another fall, or to dig
          a
          snow hole. We’ve also put additional sections down the outside of both upper arms, lats, and head, so if you
          do
          go to sleep on your side on rough ground, your jacket won’t tear in the night. And as every 1mph increase in
          wind speed is the equivalent to a drop in temperature of 3.6F, all our materials are windproof.</p>

        <p>The pull cords either side of the hood are designed to be easy enough to operate even if you’re slipping
          towards unconsciousness. Below 24.8F you lose nearly half your heat through your head. Keeping your hood up
          and tight will reduce this dramatically.</p>

        <p>Finally, if you’re found unconscious, our jacket comes with a label in the right hand pocket for you to fill
          in
          your name, nationality, emergency phone number, allergies and blood type before you head out. This way, no-one
          has to expose you to cold searching for your wallet or phone to work out who the half-dead guy is.</p>
