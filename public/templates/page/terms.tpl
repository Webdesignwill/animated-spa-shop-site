      <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
      <p>The information below lays out the Vollebak Terms &amp; Conditions of Trade. It explains how your order will be dealt with, your rights and our duty to you. </p>
      <p>Please read these Terms &amp; Conditions of Trade carefully before ordering. You should understand that by ordering Our Goods, You agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions of Trade.</p>

      <p>We recommend you keep a copy of these Terms &amp; Conditions of Trade for future reference. We will also file a copy of any Orders made by You.</p>

      <h3>2. Our contract</h3>
      <p>2.1 Your order ("Order") constitutes an offer to Us to buy the Goods you select via your Order on the Website. All Orders are subject to availability and acceptance by Us. We will send You an email acknowledging receipt of Your Order. Please note that this does not constitute acceptance by Us. The contract for purchase of the Goods is agreed and accepted by Us only when We send You an email dispatch confirmation. We will assign an order number to your Order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order.</p>
      <p>2.2 If we are unable to accept your Order, we will inform you of this in writing and will not charge you for the Goods. This might be because the Goods are out of stock, because a credit reference we have obtained for you does not meet our minimum requirements, or because we have identified an error in the price or description of the product</p>
      <p>2.3 Goods may vary slightly from their pictures. The images of goods on our Website are for illustrative purposes only. Although We have made every effort to display the colours accurately, We cannot guarantee that a device's display of the colours accurately reflects the colour of the Goods. Your Order may vary slightly from those images.</p>
      <p>2.4 If You wish to make a change to the Goods You have ordered please contact Us as set out in Section 1.2. We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible We will let you know about any changes to the price of the Order, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask You to confirm whether You wish to go ahead with the change. If not possible, a full refund will be issued and you will be added to a waitlist and contacted when the Goods are next available to order or preorder.</p>
      <h3>3. Registration, passwords and security</h3>

Prices shown are inclusive of UK Value Added Tax and any other applicable taxes (but do not include delivery costs as set out in Section 5.4).</p>
      <p>5.2 Prices are checked regularly. However, if We find the price has changed or that there has been a pricing error when We receive Your Order, We will contact You and ask if You wish to proceed at the correct price. If You confirm that You do wish to proceed, then your confirmation constitutes a new Order to us. Please remember that We will not be obliged to supply the Goods until We have sent You an email dispatch confirmation. </p>
      <p>5.3 Goods will be dispatched by Royal Mail, Courier, UPS or Fedex International.</p>

      <p>6.1 We want You to be happy with Your purchase from Us. If you are unhappy with the Goods in any way please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@vollebak.com">contact@vollebak.com</a></p>
      <p>6.2 Nothing in these Terms &amp; Conditions of Trade is intended to affect Your statutory rights. These rights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>That any Goods supplied by Us will be fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality and will conform to the description given.</li>
        <li>Certain remedies if Goods are defective.</li>
        <li>A right to cancel within a specified period and receive a full refund even if they are not defective, as set out in paragraph 6.3 below.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>6.3 If for any reason you are unhappy with Your Goods, in addition to your statutory rights under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, we offer you the right to cancel Your Order, return the Goods to us and receive a full refund provided that You have not yet worn, washed or in any other way damaged or modified the Goods, and You return the Goods to us in the same condition in which you received them within 30 days of the confirmed delivery date. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Goods while they are in your possession.</p>
      <p>6.4 To return goods to us, please email returns@vollebak.com stating your order number, what item and size you’re returning, and as much information as you can about why you’re returning it. Once we’ve received your email, we’ll ask you to repack and reseal the clothing and Mission Sack in its original packaging to protect it in transit.</p>
      <p>You’ll find a pre-printed Vollebak returns address sticker contained in the original paperwork on the outside of your delivery. Our returns address is:</p>
      <p>Vollebak<br />
        c/o CSM<br />
        Bermondsey Trading Estate<br />

      <p>6.5 If You decide to return the Goods, You can use a carrier of Your choice. Please obtain a certificate of posting or a receipt of return with price for return paid from the carrier or post office and keep it safe until you have received your exchanged Goods. We will refund You the return postage costs in accordance with the fees set out in 6.6 below. We can’t accept customs charges on returns, so You must attach the commercial invoice from Your original delivery to the outside of the envelope and clearly write, “British return. Goods returned under warrantee.” You must also clearly write the Export Tracking Number from your original invoice on the outside of the envelope.</p>
      <p>6.6 Your right of return and cancellation as explained above is without prejudice to your local statutory right of cancellation.

If you require a refund, We will refund the value of your order for those Goods including any delivery charges as stated in Section 6.6. </p>
      <p>6.8 Please note that if You fail to take reasonable care of returned Goods, or fail to return the Goods to Us, We will be entitled to make a claim against you for any losses which we suffer.</p>

You will find a Vollebak returns address sticker for return of Goods contained in the original paperwork which was sent with Your Order. If You are exercising Your rights under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 You must send off the goods within 14 days of telling Us You wish to end the contract.</p>
      <p>6.12 If You need to exchange Your Goods for another size, since We are only making limited stock, We cannot guarantee that You will be able to exchange your Goods for an alternative size. As such, We recommend You check Our sizing guide before You purchase any Goods to see which size will fit You best. Please email exchanges@vollebak.com if You would like to try to exchange your Order for another size. We will reply within 5 working days to confirm whether We still have the new size available.</p>
      <p>6.13 If We do have the size available, please follow the process as set out above in Sections 6.4 and 6.5 to return the Goods.
